= I installed the plugin ...what now? =

After installing and activating the plugin, you will need to go to *Settings > Bloglovin'* in your WP dashboard. On this page, enter the link to your Blog's Bloglovin' profile (not your personal profile). Now your follower count will be fetched twice per day. You can display this via our widget, shortcode or by calling a php function.

= Do I need to log in to Bloglovin' or enter my user details? =

Nope! This plugin won't request any details other than a link to your blog's profile on Bloglovin'.  Simple as that.

= Why hasn't my follower count updated? =

The follower count is updated twice per day via the WordPress cron. Try visitng your site in a few hours time and see if it updates then.  If it still won't work, feel free to [contact us](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bloglovin-widget) and we'll be happy to help :)
